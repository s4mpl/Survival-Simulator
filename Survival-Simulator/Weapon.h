class Weapon {
	// general weapon superclass, will have an id, overloadable shoot, stats, getInfo(), etc. -- replace hard-coding it into Player
	// handle weapon upgrades here as well (laser sight, faster attack/reload, more ammo, alt-fire, etc.)
	// weapon buff idea: attack/move faster the lower your health is
	// sniper, shotgun, smg, rifle, dual pistol, smart pistol (bullet follows mouse), frag grenade, gauss rifle (charge)
	// explosive barrel (red-orange -> red color when close to exploding based on hp)
